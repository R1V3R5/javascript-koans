Get yo enlightenment on...

The javascript koans are your path to enlightenment in JavaScript. They are a great review into many of the concepts we have learned and will introduce you to unit tests in JavaScript.

## Learning Objectives

* Have a basic understanding of unit tests work
* Show an understanding of, arrays, objects, functions, inheritance & higher order functions (functional style programming).

## Normal Mode

1. Head over here & Fork the project
2. Delete the existing gh-pages branch (do this on github)
3. Clone down your fork of it
4. Change the `KoansRunner.html` to `index.html` - so you can deploy it
5. Open the test suite at `index.html`
6. Make all 53 Koans pass - make sure there is 53 of them. <-- seriously... 53 of them!
7. Make sure to commit after each section so you don't loose any work

## Deliverables

* A link to your koans repo with all of the 53 koans passing.
* A link to your deployed `Surge.sh` page.

## Deploy

* Type surge
* Leave the project path as is... just hit "enter"
    * Name it if you'd like, thought it doesn't matter too much
